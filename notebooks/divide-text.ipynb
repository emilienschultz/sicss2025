       " ['Glaciers in the wider Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges are a crucial water source for around 240 million people in the mountainous regions, as well as for another 1.65 billion people in the South Asian and Southeast Asian river valleys below. '],\n",

       " ['We must end the fossil fuel age,\" he said. '],\n",
